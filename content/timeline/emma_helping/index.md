It was a really, really interesting couple of days. And I think for me, probably having never really been in a tower block before, all the front doors might look the same and all the corridors were the same material. But it made me think having never worked in housing before what the lives actually were behind the doors, we helped some elderly, vulnerable people and we signposted people to services where maybe they needed support with the benefits. So actually, we'd gone in there to clean for two days, but actually we felt like we were part of the community.
