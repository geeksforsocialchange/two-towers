When you were between the two flats, it caused a wind tunnel. They built a concierge between the two flats because unfortunately, a nurse got murdered in the flats. And they put CCTV, and they had security staff, 24 hours in there. The only people that could get in were the people that have keys, if you didn't have a key, you didn't get in. [It was actually] fantastic because it took away that wind that sort of circulated between the two flats.
