By now [my grandad] seemed to be becoming something of a local celebrity! On May 23 1986, aged 95, he was a guest of honour at a charity wrestling match at the QEH. He was picked up by the Mayoral car and got a signed photo of local wrestler Marty Jones. In June that year he was dancing at the Tower Ballroom Blackpool and was introduced to the organist, Phil Kelsall. In August, the Advertiser newspaper featured an article on him dancing with his new partner, 84 year old Annie Buckley from Shaw.
