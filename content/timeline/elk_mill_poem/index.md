alt: A photo of a poem called Elk Mill 1927 - 1999. The text of the poem reads "Like a beacon Elk Mill stood, <br> Of brick and stone, steel and wood. <br> Shining brightly, night and day,<br> a focal point from motorway.<br> <br> Standing there in all it’s glory,<br> A special part of the Shiloh story.<br> Though crafted from such mortal things,<br> There bear inside a heart that sings.<br> <br> The last refrain so melancholy,<br> From the mill once dubbed as Tommy’s Folly.<br> News of it’s closure, grim and stark,<br> The land will be a Retail Park.<br> <br> The last mill built in the old tradition,<br> Lost through unfair competition.<br> The famous phrase no longer read,<br> Of ‘Britain’s Bread’ and ‘Lancashire’s Thread’. <br> <br> Due to trade’s disruptive condition,<br> The mill’s now gone, despite opposition.<br> Elk Mill demolished before it’s time,<br> Elk was supreme, still in it’s prime.<br> <br> And now the dust has finally cleared,<br> The feeling of loss can seem quite weird.<br> A piece of Shiloh met an early end,<br> As sad as the death of a very close friend.<br> <br> I’ve heard of people who openly cried,<br> On hearing that Elk Mill had died.<br> But as the months turn into years,<br> Memories fade as did those tears.<br> <br> And if mills have a heaven to call their own, <br> Elk Mill will have found a good home." The poem is by Denis Schofield. Behind the poem is a faded image of some smiling women in front of some mill equipment.
