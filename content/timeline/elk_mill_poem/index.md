image_alt: A photo of a poem called Elk Mill 1927 - 1999. The text of the poem reads 'Like a beacon Elk Mill stood, Of brick and stone, steel and wood. Shining brightly, night and day, a focal point from motorway. Standing there in all it’s glory, A special part of the Shiloh story. Though crafted from such mortal things, There bear inside a heart that sings. The last refrain so melancholy, From the mill once dubbed as Tommy’s Folly. News of it’s closure, grim and stark, The land will be a Retail Park. The last mill built in the old tradition, Lost through unfair competition. The famous phrase no longer read, Of ‘Britain’s Bread’ and ‘Lancashire’s Thread’.  Due to trade’s disruptive condition, The mill’s now gone, despite opposition. Elk Mill demolished before it’s time, Elk was supreme, still in it’s prime. And now the dust has finally cleared, The feeling of loss can seem quite weird. A piece of Shiloh met an early end, As sad as the death of a very close friend. I’ve heard of people who openly cried, On hearing that Elk Mill had died. But as the months turn into years, Memories fade as did those tears. And if mills have a heaven to call their own, Elk Mill will have found a good home.' The poem is by Denis Schofield. Behind the poem is a faded image of some smiling women in front of some mill equipment.

After the closure of the mill, many workers were deeply saddened by the loss of not just their livelihoods, but the social life and community of the mill. Former mill worker Denis Schofield wrote this poem about his experience of the mill closing.
