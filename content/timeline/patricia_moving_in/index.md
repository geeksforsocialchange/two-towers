I moved into Vale Drive [close to the towers] on the 23rd of October 1976. As you come onto the estate, itâ€™s the first avenue. The towers had just been built when I moved in. Everybody was very young. They were all young families. I mean, me and my husband were only 26. Everybody had children and the children went to the school and the school was on the estate as well, that was called Richmond Street School. Where we lived on Vale Drive you knew everybody. And everybody knew you. So it was a clannish atmosphere.
