We had a beautiful meadow. And every year when the flowers used to come up, we had bluebells, whitebells, they'd start first, then the daffodils, daffodils are my favourite flower. They're so pretty. Then you'd get these beautiful meadow flowers, that you'd not seen for years, coming up. So it was nice to sit out. I had a nice garden of my own by this time, you know, my husband put a fish pond in and and we had a water feature. But we still liked sitting out in the community gardens. The view of Eden Field and Rochdale was wonderful.
