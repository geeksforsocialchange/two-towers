We had a big party at our house on Millennium Eve, invited 57 people, and they all turned up, every single one of them. What a night we had. It was wonderful. At 12 o'clock, we all went out in the street doing the conga right up the street, right back down. My son then must have been, 30? He went out with a couple of his mates and set all the fireworks off. And we set ours off and it was as if all the world had set the fireworks off at the same time. It was phenomenal. Yeah, that was another good memory.
