Brenda, who was over at Summervale House, she ran their community room there and it was run like a tight ship. We used to go once a month on a Tuesday evening. We used to take it in turns, the men would put all the chairs away nice, and tidy and fluff up the cushions. And the ladies washing the pots, drying them and putting them away.
