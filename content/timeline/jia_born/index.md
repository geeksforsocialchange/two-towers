I was born [near St. Thomas Church] me, I grew up in that area and you know the two towers, they were like landmarks. When we were younger, my dad used to take us on days out to other towns — when we used to get on the motorway and when we saw the two towers we know we were close to home. You know that was our landmark. You know we could see it, we’re about 10 minutes away from home.
