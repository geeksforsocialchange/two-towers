The lady that ran Summervale House. She was called Brenda and she let us get a residents association. And this patch of spare land that we had at the back of Vale Drive. We got these artists that came down. There were all sorts that we could turn to. They were brilliant with us, and the council gave us money and we decided we'd do this at the back side of Vale Drive. It was absolutely wonderful. We had Japanese knotweed, so that had to be treated, before we could do anything. We had two cabins delivered that were put on the corner of Vale Drive and we used them three times a week in the holidays for the children to come in. And we went on the theme of magic, the kids wanted witches and stuff like that. So we got these arty farty people to come down and work with children, and they made this community garden. And the kids ended up, they wanted a dragon type thing, or unicorn thing. The kids actually made it out of broken tiles.
