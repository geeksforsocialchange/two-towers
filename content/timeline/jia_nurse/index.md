My ex’s grandfather used to live in the building, I remember her telling me once, she was really upset — she said “oh, do you know grandad Tom, Tommy”, I went “yeah”, she said “well the same building that he lives, just above him, a Filipino NHS worker had fallen out the window and died”, so that was one of my memories from the building. Its not a really good memory but I used to remember it, you know when I drive past, I used to remember her words in my head, that someone had actually fallen out the window and died.
