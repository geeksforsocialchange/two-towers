My ex partner's grandfather used to live in the building, I remember her telling me once, she was really upset â€” she said "oh, do you know Grandad Tom, Tommy", she said "well the same building that he lives, just above him, one of his neighbours, A Filipino lady who worked for the NHS was killed", so that was one of my memories from the building. It's not a really good memory but I used to remember it, you know when I drive past, I used to remember her words in my head, that someone had passed away.
