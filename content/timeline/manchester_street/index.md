image_alt: A black and white photo of a view down a busy road, which has plenty of cars on it. There are street lamps and houses lining the road, with a row of shops visible in the background. The road seems to curve off to the right, uphill from the photographâ€™s perspective. There is a yellow piece of paper stuck to the bottom, which reads Manchester ST. 1965 # If there is one
