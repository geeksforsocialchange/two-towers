image_alt: A black and white image seemingly copied from a publication or newspaper, which features a row of houses with one house featuring a number of chimneys, turrets, and other castle-like features. It sticks out from the row of houses a long way. There is an iron fence and some cars parked in the foreground of the image. At the bottom of the image there is a caption which reads “York Castle on York Street, Bank Top. This house was built by a local steeplejack, Joe Ball and demolished on the 16th October 1968” # If there is one
