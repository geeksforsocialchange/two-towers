The family moved in next door to us, they were lovely. Their oldest son was about 12 at the time and he was a very, very clever lad and we asked them if he would be a junior in our residents association and could he organise a football team, and he was so pleased. And his parents were so proud of him, he used to come once a month and he'd tell us about [it]. And we got a coach down from Oldham Athletic and that boosted the kids morale because, you know, it was well known coach. That was when sort of the community started to integrate again, although it was more ethnic.
