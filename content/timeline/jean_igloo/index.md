It was nice to not be in where cars are flying about. We had an ice cream man what came with a horse and cart believe it or not. I'm not, it sounds like, it sounds Dickensian but it was, the horse come. And, the milk, the milkman, you know, we didn't have a milkman like they have and dad, before he died built us kids all a big igloo for us all to play and the milkman tried to come down the street. And the Milkman couldn't deliver the milk because we'd built an igloo.
