Working in [the towers], you get all sort of incidents, they weren’t very good memories as we had to throw loads of partying youths out. There would be teenagers inside on the bottom floor getting drunk, they would creep in somehow. Because it was a massive place they could get in and out easy without being spotted. We could hear kids messing about in the basement. Then you could see them all partying, then we would have to escort them out and they would be back a couple of days later. That’s how our time passed most of the time.
