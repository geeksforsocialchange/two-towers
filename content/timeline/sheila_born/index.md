I was born on Crossbank Street, Oldham in 1946. Crossbank Street ran along from the corner of Manchester Street. From my home on Crossbank Street you could look down towards Manchester Street which had shops running down it. Bankside Mill could be seen through the junction. It was then an engineering factory, selling wood instead of coal.
