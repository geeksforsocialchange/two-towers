The first thing I remember about my visits is that whenever I entered the door to [my grandfather's] corridor, I was hit with the smell of cooking from all the flats. And it didn't seem to matter what time of day it was! His flat faced towards the town centre so was an ideal home for someone of his age as he could watch the world go by from his window. Also, residents passing by would wave to him.
