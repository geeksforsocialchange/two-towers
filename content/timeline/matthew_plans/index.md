I've been here 12 years and [the towers] were always a big part of what First Choice Homes did, they were always on the conversations. What should we do for them? Should we change them into studios? Apartments? There was lots of conversations always surrounding them, and I think it was the area. And I just think although it's sad to see them go, with what's coming up, I just think that the area is going to get what it deserves in some of the plans that are going forward.
