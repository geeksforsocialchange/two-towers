Hard-working is the phrase most often used to describe the character of the people in the borough. There is a sense of Oldhamers not being afraid to get their hands dirty – to be willing to roll up their sleeves and get on with things – that by instinct they want to improve their lot by being ‘canny’ and enterprising about what they do. Oldham people are also seen as friendly and good-humoured, although there was a feeling that Oldham people have had to put up with disappointments and hard times.
