Thereâ€™s a lot of Asians on there now. But you know what, they're great with my mum? They call her grandma, they all call her granny. They give her food and everything. So she likes it. [Her house is] just a little bit big for her now because it's a three bedroom house but they bought it, it's been paid for for years. She wants to move then she doesn't, she said 'no, I won't get good neighbours like this'. She's quite happy there, [even though] it's not as nice anymore.
