All of a sudden you would hear de de de de de, so we would go down and they’ve got their little boom boxes and their little alcohol bottles and we would go right guys, you’re gonna have to go and we would escort them out and they would be back the next weekend. There used to be loads of them about 15-20, 30 at some times. All local community lads, Bangladeshi lads, Pakistani lads from around the area. There was All sorts of people all young people just teenagers really. Just …. Boys and girls. It was illuminated, the lights were still working, the electrics were still working, it was like a big enclosed space for them to chill out in, it was like a party house like when we used to go raving back in the day, but under the towers!
