My grandfather moved to 10 Crossbank House, where he had a one bedroom, ground floor flat. After spending his life in a two up, two down, with outside toilet and only a cold tap in the kitchen, he thought he'd been moved to a palace and he loved his new home. An added bonus was that there was a warden who dealt with any problems, and since he was quite old by that stage, that was very reassuring for the family.
