I actually did deliveries for a Chinese chippy, Kingdo House on Abbey Hills Road, and there used to be a regular customer that always ordered. And I remember the first time I went to deliver the food, I was so scared to go into the towers. I remember standing there, like ringing the buzzer, thinking there's not a chance I'm going to in here by myself, it was. But I did. I went in, I went up like four flights of stairs and delivered the food, they tipped me Â£3, which was a massive amount at 17 with the car. And then I delivered to him like every week from there, so I did visit regularly for a couple of years whilst I did Chinese food deliveries, and then a couple of years after when I was in the party stage of my life.
