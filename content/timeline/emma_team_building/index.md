About 10 years ago, when I took on managing the [towers cleaning] team I think we had about thirty six cleaners and we had a team building day because there was myself, and another manager, Helen. And we didn't really know the team. Some of them have been there for many years and we wanted to see the standards of cleaning. So what we did was across two days for a team building event, we took all the caretakers and we split them up into their normal working teams and we asked them clean the floor each of the towers. They were like mazes. We were running up and down the stairs and the lifts. It was just a crazy two days. It was good from a work perspective because we got to meet some residents and we got to talk to them about how they felt about living in the blocks at the time.
