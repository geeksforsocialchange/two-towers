We were used to a lot of people and then when people started moving out there were like handfuls, one on each floor maybe. It was very very odd when we did our rounds you. We knew all the buildings. And then you could hear on one floor or you could smell curries, cooking people playing music or watching tv and you thought its not totally dead theres still some life left in the building. It made us feel good when we knew someone was there.
