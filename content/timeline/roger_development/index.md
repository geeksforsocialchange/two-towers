If you look at most developments and you know, up until the Second World War really was done by private people, building houses, building cotton mills, things like that were all done by basically private individuals. Councils only do things like gasworks, electricity supply, fire brigade, police stations, that sort of thing really, they weren't really into actually building, even building houses really like council housing only really came in relatively late. So the big difference in World War Two was that was a more, centralised planning developed because obviously you have to have to fight the war and the government took more and more control.
