Up until the Second World War, development was mostly done by private people - building houses, cotton mills, things like that. Councils only did things like gasworks, electricity supply, fire brigade, police stations and that sort of thing - they werenâ€™t really into actually building houses. Council housing only came in relatively late. So the big difference in World War Two was that was more centralised planning developed, because obviously you have to fight the war and the government took more and more control.
