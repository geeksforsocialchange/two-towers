They've got a new estate, well it's not new now, it's been up ages, the council houses. I have to look up the streets and think, oh I just lived round the corner there, but it was a totally different layout, but I still see it when I go past sometimes when I go past in the car and I think I used to do this and used to do that and still see where I was born.
