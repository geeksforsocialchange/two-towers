The letter reads “Dear Mr. Lamb, One of the Tea Dancers that attend the Queen Elizabeth Hall is in the Town Centre at Oldham very kindly produced the article that featured yourself during August in the Oldham Chronicle and I am writing to you now to offer you a complementary ticket to use the facilities of the Queen Elizabeth Hall on any Monday afternoon or Thursday afternoon between 12.30 and 4.00 p.m. On Monday the dances tend to be a mixture of sequence and modern ballroom and on Thursdays we have a format of modern ballroom dancing and old time. I certainly admire your agility and energy at the age of 92 and it would indeed be an honour should you decide to attend the dances and you can rest assured that you will receive a very wam welcome from all the people that have been coming here for the last three years. May I wish you what you would wish yourself and good health for your remaining years. Yours sincerely [signature of D.H. Robinson] Civic Halls Manager.” The letter is on headed paper from Oldham Metropolitan Borough and Oldham Civic Hall. The scan is backed with a pink card, and has a photo in the bottom right corner of a wall with lots of cards pinned to it. # If there is one
