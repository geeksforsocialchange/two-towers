The family that moved in next door but one to me, they were a lovely, lovely family. Their kids were young, so we'd invite them all. We even had Christmas parties every year for the kids, in the pub around the corner. And we've taken them for days out, you know, to Blackpool and places like that. Although I'm getting old the memories are still there of the good times.
