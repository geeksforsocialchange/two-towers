If I could've put my house on wheels and pushed it away to where I live now I would have done. They're pulling them down now, if they're not already down. I passed last week and it was my friend's turn to drive the car, so I could look, you know? And I just burst out crying. We had so many friends in the flats. There were six people that worked at Ferranti, which was a local firm where I worked at. And the views from them flats were amazing, especially the top floors. Oh, they were phenomenal, you could see Manchester Airport. And you could see Jodrell Bank.
