The ethnic community wouldn't come to the pub but we were always putting on pie and peas suppers on and things like that. [So we’d] take them to the people. If they had a wedding, they'd always bring [delicious food, like curries]. They’d bring you food, they'd bring you lots of fruit. So obviously when we had something, we went round the estate, giving it out too, you know.
