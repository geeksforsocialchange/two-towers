The Muslim community often don’t drink, so they wouldn’t come to the pub, but we were always putting on pie and peas suppers and things like that. [So we’d] share them with the community. If there was a wedding, there would always be delicious food shared like curries. There would be food and lots of fruit. So obviously when we had a celebration, we would share this around with neighbours, giving this out too.
