image_alt: A scan of a page in a book which has two newspaper clippings taped to it. One is about Andrew Lamb, from Oldham, making career advances with Friends Provident. The other has the headline ‘John misses last waltz’, describing the Christmas tea dance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall which happened without John, as he passed away in hospital the week before. This clipping is accompanied with a large black and white photo of John, and below it ‘Northern Scrapbook - OLDHAM CHRONICLE 21 December 1989’ is written in pen.  # If there is one

Sadly, my grandfather died in hospital on December 13 1989, exactly 2 months before his 99th birthday. I often wonder if my grandfather was the oldest resident to live in the Two Towers.
