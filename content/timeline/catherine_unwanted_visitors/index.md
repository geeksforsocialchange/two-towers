After some time, security became a problem at the flats and a system was introduced to prevent unwanted visitors entering the building. Unfortunately, this led to another problem as people then started knocking on ground floor windows near to the external doors if they wanted to get in. My grandfather, whose window was next to the door, found this very disturbing.
