My aunty became the warden of Summervale House for the first 5 floors upon the opening of the building. The first 5 floors accommodated residents of pension age. I remember my aunty used to make morning visits to the residents on the first 5 floors and in the afternoon, activities used to be run for the residents of both blocks in the communal room, such as bingo. On a regular basis, residents used to host birthday parties in the communal room during the evening, and celebrate other events.
