It reminds me of old friends and also the coming of a new year with all its possibilities. May our future relationships be as pleasant as the past… We have valued your business and desire you to accept our thanks… Our aim, as it always has been, is to be consistent in quality and service… With all good wishes, We are yours faithfully, ELK MILL.

Shiloh Spinners both ran Elk Mill and were heavily involved in the everyday lives of their workers. A key statement of their work practises included their involvement with their workers in social activities. Workers would engage with sports day activities as well as pageants, and more. These qualities of leadership made workers quite fond of Shiloh Spinners, and many were excited to work for the company.
