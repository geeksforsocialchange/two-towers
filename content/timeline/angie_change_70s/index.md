The whole town was changing it seemed in the seventies. Lots of new concrete builds and a lot of terraced houses being knocked down. I remember that distinctly. But there were playgrounds for kids like me, collecting bonfire wood and hanging around on street corners and dereliction was really a big part of my childhood watching the terraced houses come down.
