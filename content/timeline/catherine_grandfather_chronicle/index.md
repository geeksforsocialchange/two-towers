My grandfather was lucky to stay fit, although he was deaf and, by the end of his life, almost blind. He'd always been interested in the theatre, music and dancing and attended Platts Social Club on Featherstall Road South until it closed. The Oldham Chronicle visited him at that time to record his disappointment at the closure, and an article and photo appeared in the paper on Wednesday August 25, 1982. This led to an invitation for him to attend the twice weekly tea dances at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. He made many kind friends there who looked after him well. He was still dancing twice a week, and on his 93rd birthday on February 13, 1984 he was treated to a visit from a scantily clad, singing kissogram!
