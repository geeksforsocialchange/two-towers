We had a beautiful house when you think I bought it for £10,500 and sold it for £159,000. But because of the troubles that we had. I mean, you know, I don't know whether you've read about it or not but, we were frightened to go out, it was that bad. The police used to have to take us shopping, all the ladies. Take us shopping to Asda and that, in their cars. It was horrible.
