It was lovely [to grow up here]. Everybody knew everybody who like you see them on the television when they stood on front talking. Because there's nothing else to do. We didn't have a telly. We just played, played out. And mothers just did the cleaning, do you know what I mean? it was just easy. Well, not if you were a mother I suppose.
