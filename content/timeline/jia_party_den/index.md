[We] had a handful of people left in the building, who couldnâ€™t get rehoused. We were watching it as they had youths getting in, using it as a party den down at the garage down at the bottom. So we were securing it making sure no one else could get in or out whilst there was residents still in there. Obviously because of safety issues.
