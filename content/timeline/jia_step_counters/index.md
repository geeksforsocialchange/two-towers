There was two of us on duty all the time, in the first building we would go up to the top, get the lift to the top, and we would walk down the stairs down all the way round and it used to take us 25 minutes, 35 minutes. From the top of one building to the bottom and then get in the other one, and do the same again, it would take us an hour to check both buildings, then we would have half an hour rest and then we were back out again. It kept us fit thatâ€™s all I can say to you! We had step counters on see how many we would do in a day. Sometimes we would go over 10,000 steps just in there.
