Aw they were nice flats yeah. I thought they were brilliant. Yeah they were lovely. I used to do a bit of courting with my first boyfriend. Like underneath, there used to be like a little ginnel and a cubbyhole. And everybody used to meet in there with boyfriends, and everything. It were honestly, it was great memories.
