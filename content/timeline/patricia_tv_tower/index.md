So it was it was a lovely atmosphere, and that was the real reason why we [bought a house on the estate]. We [first moved there] in 76 and we bought in August 1980. (Fact check this â€” interview unclear) And my husband was an avid DIYer. At the back of our house, we were on a plateau, and on a clear night you could see the television tower, I think they call it Belmont, which is over past Rochdale like. All those neighbours that lived on the back of Vale Drive. We always wanted this piece of spare ground that was just left there. We always wanted to do something with it.
