The community room was very, very old fashioned. It was probably a flat at one time, a tiny bathroom that always smelt no matter how much it was cleaned. And then one long community room, there were bookcases so people could come and do a book swap. And then we literally just fund tea and toast. And they really felt they created their own mini community from behind the doors of the flat, and it was the same people every week. Interestingly, we used the community rooms when we consulted all the residents in the two tower blocks about moving out prior to the demolition that's just occurred. So actually, it's had some really probably nice times and some challenging times in that community room.
