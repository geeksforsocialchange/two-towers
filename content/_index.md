subtitle:  'A history of Summervale and Crossbank'

[cCc] *The Towers: A history of Summervale and Crossbank* is a digital community project designed to create a digital archive of the West Street Area in Coldhurst, Oldham, with a focus on the time Summervale House and Crossbank House stood (1975 - 2022). 

This site hosts a timeline of personal stories, news, and archival images, to allow you to explore this part of Oldham's history, as told by residents, neighbours, and those who passed through. It's arranged chronologically, to show the changing area through time, and follows the stories of those living in and around the towers.
